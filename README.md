To develop a prediction system model for diabetic patient  for their glucose levels
The UCI Diabetes Data Repository was used to predict the blood glucose level. The data was sparse, and hence, had to be pre-processed to a csv format.
Multiple imputation methods were compared, and MICE imputation proved to be the best imputation, and the imputed data set was used to build a decision tree model to predict blood glucose level
